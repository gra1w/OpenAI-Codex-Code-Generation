**Emergent Gravity:** A Modern Perspective on a Timeless Conundrum

**1. Introduction**

Emergent Gravity theories propose a radical shift in our understanding of Gravity, positing it as an emerging phenomenon from more fundamental physics rather than an intrinsic force described by its own field in the Lagrangian of the Universe (Roberts et al., 2014). This paradigm challenge conventional perspectives encapsulated in General Relativity (GR) and quantum gravitational theories, where Gravity is postulated as an integral part of the structural foundation of spacetime (DeWitt & Misner, 1965; Hawking & Ellis, 1973). Instead, emergent gravity concepts posit that Gravity arises as a collective behavior of lower-level degrees of freedom, opening up intriguing possibilities for unifying Quantum Mechanics and GR within a single theoretical framework (Susskind, 2003). In this extended exposition, we delve into three prominent approaches to emergent gravity: holographic gravity, Loop Quantum Gravity with large scale effects, and Conformal Cyclic Cosmology.

**2. Holographic Emergent Gravity**

Holography is one such approach to emergent gravity, which posits that Gravity in higher dimensions can be described as an effective theory emerging from a conformal field theory (CFT) living on the boundary of Anti-de Sitter (AdS) space (Maldacena, 1997; Gubser et al., 1998). The bulk Graviton corresponds to excitations of the CFT, and the metric structure in the bulk arises as a result of correlations between CFT operators (Bousso & Hartle, 2000). The holographic principle asserts that the entropy of a region in AdS space scales with its boundary surface area rather than its volume (Hooft, 1993; Susskind, 1994), suggesting a profound connection between information and geometry. This principle enables powerful tools for studying quantum gravity phenomena at large scales, allowing for exact solutions and insights into the behavior of gravitational systems (McGreevy, 2006). However, extending holography to flat, Minkowski spacetime or addressing the ultraviolet (UV) completion of the theory remains an open question (Strominger, 2001).

In holographic gravity, Gravity emerges as an effective description arising from the collective behavior of degrees of freedom in the CFT. The AdS/CFT correspondence, a duality between the bulk gravitational theory and the boundary CFT, provides a framework for understanding this emergence (Witten, 1998). In this picture, the gravitational interaction between objects in the bulk translates to correlations between CFT operators on the boundary. These correlations give rise to the observed gravitational force, making Gravity an emergent phenomenon. Holography offers a controlled setting for exploring quantum gravity effects and provides insights into the behavior of gravitational systems at large scales, but it faces challenges in fully reconciling the microscopic description with the well-established macroscopic laws of GR and extending the approach to flat spacetimes and UV completions.

**3. Loop Quantum Gravity with Large Scale Effects**

Another intriguing approach to emergent gravity is Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG), a canonical quantization attempt to GR that replaces the continuous spacetime description with a discrete, quantum lattice structure (Rovelli & Smolin, 1995; Ashtekar & Lewandowski, 2004). In LQG, Gravity is described by spin networks, which encode both geometric and topological information. A key prediction of LQG is the existence of a length scale, the Planck length, beyond which classical GR descriptions break down, and quantum effects become dominant (Smolin et al., 1997; Rovelli, 2004). However, reconciling LQG's microscopic description with the well-established macroscopic laws of GR poses significant challenges, particularly in understanding the emergence of Gravity from the underlying quantum structure (Thiemann, 2007).

Recent developments in LQG suggest that Gravity may emerge as a collective effect of the interplay between quantum fluctuations and averaging over coarse-grained degrees of freedom at large scales (Rovelli & Vidotto, 2008; Bojowald et al., 2018). This approach offers a promising route towards merging quantum mechanics and general relativity but requires further investigation to fully understand the nature of the emergent Gravity and its implications for cosmology and black hole physics (Bianchi et al., 2011). The challenge lies in bridging the gap between the microscopic quantum description and the macroscopic classical behavior while preserving the symmetries and conservation laws of GR.

**4. Conformal Cyclic Cosmology**

Conformal Cyclic Cosmology (CCC) represents yet another emergent gravity scenario within the context of a cyclic universe model (Ellis et al., 1983; Steinhardt & Turok, 1994). In CCC, the Universe undergoes an infinite sequence of contraction and expansion phases, with each cycle governed by a conformally invariant theory describing matter and radiation (Linde, 1990; Vilenkin, 1998). The gravitational force arises as an effective long-range interaction emerging from short-range interactions between fundamental constituents, such as quantum strings or point particles, in the early universe (Vilenkin, 2006). CCC addresses several challenges posed by standard Big Bang cosmology, including the fine-tuning problem and the horizon problem, while providing a framework for unifying quantum mechanics and general relativity (Linde, 2007).

However, CCC faces criticisms regarding the mechanism driving the cyclic evolution and the lack of a definitive connection to observational data (Tolley et al., 2004; Ellis et al., 2005). One proposed mechanism for the cyclic evolution is the quantum bounce, where the universe contracts due to quantum fluctuations until reaching a singularity, at which point it expands again (Linde, 2007). Another challenge is reconciling CCC with the observed cosmic microwave background radiation, which appears to be consistent with a Big Bang origin. Addressing these issues requires further investigation into the underlying physics and potential modifications to the CCC model.

In summary, emergent gravity theories propose Gravity as an emerging phenomenon from more fundamental physics, challenging conventional understandings encapsulated in GR and quantum gravitational theories. Holography, Loop Quantum Gravity, and Conformal Cyclic Cosmology are three prominent approaches to emergent gravity, each offering intriguing possibilities for unifying quantum mechanics and general relativity while addressing various challenges posed by current theories. However, each approach also faces open questions and requires further investigation to fully understand the nature of emergent Gravity and its implications for cosmology and black hole physics. Ultimately, these theories may provide new insights into the fundamental structure of our Universe and help us better understand the interplay between quantum mechanics and general relativity.
