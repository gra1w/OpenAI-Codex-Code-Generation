## Overview
The OpenAI-Codex-Code-Generation repository features a multitude of applications fully coded by AI. It is a testament to the cutting-edge capabilities of AI in automated code generation.

## Process 
1. **Idea Generation**: GPT-4 kickstarts the process by generating a unique idea.
2. **Decomposition**: The idea is broken down into a comprehensive step-by-step approach.
3. **Code Generation**: Based on this approach, Copilot X takes up the helm by writing code.
4. **Testing**: Copilot X then meticulously tests the code to ensure it functions as expected.
5. **Upload**: If the code proves successful, it gets uploaded for users to access and use.
